# Kriisosaaja
Kriisiosaaja is a game prototype for a learning game developed for the Department of Health and Emergency Care Education of South-Eastern University of Applied Sciences. Within the game the player has to take care of the needs of their character and manage at home for 72 hours during a power outage. 

I worked as the main programmer for the project during my studies. The project lasted approximately 02/2024-09/2024, though proper work started around May. Most every piece of code within project, excluding UI and in-game phone related stuff is designed and written by me.  

The plan for the project was to build a prototype of a learning game to teach crisis management and survival at home for 72 hours during a crisis, such as a power outage or a pandemia. The game took inspiration from games such as Project Zomboid and The Sims 1.  

I wrote my bachelor thesis on how the codebase of the project could be improved. Within the thesis I dove into what clean and maintainable code is and how it’s written. I then took examples of “bad code” from the project and gave broadly applicable suggestions on how the code base of the project could be improved. The thesis is in Finnish and can be found on Theseus.fi. Link to the thesis: https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/874315  

Now, not even a year later, and even as I was researching for and writing the thesis, I’ve come to see many deeply flawed decisions made during the project regarding its code base architecture and execution, though I try to see that as a sign of professional growth. I did my best with the time and know-how I had at the time. Nowadays I’d probably build the project quite differently.
